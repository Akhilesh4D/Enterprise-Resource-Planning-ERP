Flow of the ERP System
The Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) System will have a structured flow covering authentication, user roles, module interactions, and real-time updates. Here’s a detailed breakdown of how the system will work:

🔹 1. User Authentication & Authorization
Flow:
User accesses the login page.
User enters credentials → JWT Authentication (or OAuth2 SSO for Google, Microsoft).
Backend verifies credentials → Issues JWT token with role-based access.
Token stored in LocalStorage/SessionStorage.
User is redirected to Dashboard based on role.
If unauthorized, redirect to Access Denied (403) Page.
✅ Learning Areas: OAuth2, JWT, Guards, Interceptors, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

🔹 2. Dashboard (Role-Based View)
Flow:
Based on the user role, show different widgets:
Admin: Employee count, departments, revenue summary.
Manager: Team performance, task overview.
Employee: Assigned tasks, notifications.
Dashboard fetches real-time data via WebSockets (for notifications & updates).
Interactive charts (NGX Charts / Recharts) visualize KPIs.
Clicking on widgets redirects to detailed reports/pages.
✅ Learning Areas: Lazy loading, WebSockets, RxJS, Dynamic Components, Charts.

🔹 3. Employee Management
Flow:
Admin navigates to Employee Module.
Fetch employee list from backend (server-side pagination).
Admin can:
Add a new employee (form validation, image upload).
Edit employee details.
Assign roles (dropdown with permissions).
Delete employee (soft delete for audit logs).
Employee receives email notification after changes.
✅ Learning Areas: Reactive Forms, File Uploads, Server-Side Pagination, Email APIs.

🔹 4. Role & Permission Management
Flow:
Admin opens Roles & Permissions Module.
Can create/update roles (Admin, Manager, Employee).
Assign permissions (CRUD-based access to different modules).
Backend updates the RBAC system.
Employees get updated UI based on permissions (dynamic menu).
✅ Learning Areas: Role-based UI, Angular Guards, Dynamic Menus, Backend Policies.

🔹 5. Task & Project Management
Flow:
Manager creates a Project and assigns employees.
Employees see assigned tasks on the Task Board (Kanban-style).
Employees update task status: Pending → In Progress → Completed.
Updates reflect in real-time on the manager’s dashboard.
Task deadlines trigger automated email/SMS reminders.
✅ Learning Areas: Drag & Drop (CDK), WebSockets, RxJS, Notifications.

🔹 6. Attendance & Payroll System
Flow:
Employees log attendance (check-in/check-out).
System calculates hours worked.
Payroll system generates salary based on hours worked + deductions.
Employee receives a salary slip (PDF download).
Payroll gets processed, triggering email notifications.
✅ Learning Areas: PDF Generation, Time Calculation, REST APIs, File Downloads.

🔹 7. Reporting & Analytics
Flow:
Admin selects report type (Employee Performance, Revenue, Payroll).
System fetches data and displays dynamic charts & tables.
Reports can be filtered by date, department, or employee.
Option to export reports as PDF/Excel.
✅ Learning Areas: Server-Side Filtering, Data Visualization, Export Features.

🔹 8. Notifications & Real-Time Updates
Flow:
Admin updates employee status → Employee gets real-time alert.
New tasks assigned → Employee receives push notification.
Attendance alerts for late employees.
Messages & chat updates instantly.
✅ Learning Areas: WebSockets, Push Notifications, Firebase Cloud Messaging.

🔹 9. Settings & Configuration
Flow:
Admin configures company-wide settings (themes, preferences).
Users can update profile settings, password, and preferences.
System logs all actions for audit trails.
✅ Learning Areas: Global State Management, Theme Customization, Audit Logs.

End-to-End Workflow Example (Use Case)
Admin logs in → Views the dashboard.
Admin adds a new employee → Assigns role & permissions.
Employee logs in → Views assigned tasks.
Manager creates a new project → Assigns employees.
Employee updates task status → Manager gets real-time updates.
Payroll gets generated at month-end → Employees download salary slips.
Admin exports reports → Reviews company performance.
